Motor Unit Number Estimation via Sequential Monte Carlo
Taylor, SAC., Sherloc, C., Ridall, G. and Fearnhead, P.


The files here are to complement a paper on the development and application of a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm on the question of motor unit number estimation (paper currently under review). The files contained are:
1) The R package SMCMUNE that applies the developed methodology (please refer to manual pages for usage)
2) SimForce.csv -- Contains 200 simulated data sets based on up to 10 motor units (sets 1-20: 1 motor unit, sets 21-40: 2 motor units, ..., sets 181-200: 10 motor units)
4) TrueParams.csv -- Contains information about the parameters used to genereate the above data sets. See paper for details regarding the model.
